Understanding RADIUS

RADIUS Remote Authentication Dial in or is a system of authentication credentials to sign in to access network of liberal bias


RADIUS is defined in RFC 2865 and RFC 2866, initially used to authenticate against the remote network access (remote) using a dial-up connection. RADIUS was first developed by the company Livingston. At the beginning of its development, RADIUS, use port 1645, which turned out to be clashing with the "datametrics" service. Now, port used RADIUS is port 1812.



Discussion and content

RADIUS has now been implemented to perform authentication against the access network remotely by using a dial-up connection other than, such as Virtual Private Networking (VPN), wireless access point, Ethernet switch, and other devices.

The following is an RFC (Request For Comment) related to the RADIUS:

RFC 2865: Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
RFC 2866 RADIUS Accounting
RFC 2867 RADIUS Accounting for Tunneling
RFC 2868 RADIUS Authentication for Tunneling
RFC 2869 RADIUS Extensions
RFC 3162 RADIUS over IP6
RFC 2548: Microsoft Vendor-Specific RADIUS Attribu

On a RADIUS AAA functions, namely:

1. Authentication is the process of verifying the user, usually with a username and password

2. Authorization is the process of granting network access

3. Accountine is the process of calculation of the amount of bandwidth that is used by user


Conclusions and Suggestions

RADIUS that makes it easy for Admins to meremote an acces point or network

As a suggestion should be able to increase the knowledge of RADIUS
