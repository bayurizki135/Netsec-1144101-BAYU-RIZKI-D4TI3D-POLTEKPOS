network Security

Netwok Security (network security) in the era of global kemanana as now, the system of internet-based information system into a keharisan of note, due to the nature of the internet computer network and global public are basically insecure. At the time data is sent from one computer to the other in internet, data that will pass through a number of other computers, this means going to the many ways and by many users of the internet to tap or change the data. Below is a discussion of the importance of Network Security (Network Security)
Open Systems Interconnections (OSI) was first created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that provides the framework for structured logic how to process transactions through data communications networks.
The main purpose of the use of the OSI model is to help network designers understand the various functions of each layer that has to do with the flow of communication data. Including the types of network protocols by the method of transmission
As for the explanation a bit about the workings of the OSI Layer that is when data is transferred over the network, the data must pass through before the seventh layer from one terminal, start application layer to physical layer, then on the receiver, the data passes through the physical to the application. At the time of the data passed through one layer of the sender will be plus one "header" while on the side of the recipient of the "header" layer appropriate to remove
OSI consists of several layers that consist of:
1. Physical Layer, layer the simplest relating to electrical
2. data link Layer, Layer a little more intelligent that provides a more real-world data transfer, as well as media liaison network protocol layer and the more high-level.
3. Network Layer, has a major task in providing the routing function so it can be sent out from the local network segment to a destination that is located on another network
4. transport Layer, the transport Layer protocol data using UDP, TCP
5. session Layer, this layer provides services to a two layer above, also served to do is coordinate communication between the entity layer representing
6. Presentation layer, doing only one single function, namely the translation of various types on the syntax system
7. Application Layer this Layer is the most smart screen, do the same job of gateway as a router. Application layer is the main liaison between the berjala application on one computer and sesources netwok who needs access to it.

TCP/IP (Transmission is data communication standards used by the internet community in the process of exchange of data from one computer to another in a network the internet. This Protocol can not stand on its own because this Protocol in the form of a collection of protocols. The TCP/IP protocol itself is the most widely used today.

Kinds of kinds of Layer in TCP/IP
TCP/IP is defined in 3-5 fugsi levels in the architecture of the Protocol. Following is Chart 5 layer in TCP/IP

a. Physical Layer is a layer of badly needed hardware to carry data transmissions
b. the Network Access Layer Protocol that provides a medium for the system to send data to other kedevice which are connected directly
c. the Internet Layer of the Internet, there is a protokoljantung of the TCP/IP Protocol and most importantly at the Internet layer
d. Transport Protocol, the two major protocols at this layer is the Transmission Control and User Data Protocol (UDP)
e. Application Layer is the top sides in the arsitektir TCP/IP. There are many application protocols that are most used today. Among them: TELNET i.e. Network Terminal Protocol, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for file transfer, SMTP, the Simple mail Transfer Protocol used to send electronic mail, DNS Domain Name Server to map an IP address to a specific name in the
f. RIP (Routing Information Protocol, a routing protocol
e.g. OSPF, Open Shortest Past First, routing protocol
h. NSF, Network File System for file-sharing against the hosts in the network beerbagai
i. HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, for web browsing


Conclusion
After we read and listen to the reviews about the supporting components or a discussion of OSI and TCP/IP is a network SECURITY we can deduce that the understanding of the basic theory of computer networks, network security, especially in a protocol the network is indispensable for the sake of a security provided in a network. In general the protocol functions to connect the sender and recipient side in communicating and exchanging information
