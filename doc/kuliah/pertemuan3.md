Port Scanning is an activity that is performed to examine the status of TCP and UDP ports on a particular machine. The number of applications that offer facilities to do a port inspection machines, such as netcat, nmap, unicorscan and many more. Port scanning brings some critical information that is vital to the defence of the machine and the resources that we have. Success to thwart the port scan will cause not a successful strategy of acquiring needed before the attack actually conducted.
There are several techniques â€“ the existing port scanning techniques
1. The TCP connect scan
This type of scan connect keport target and complete the three-way handshake. This type of scan is easily detected by the target system.
2. TCP SYN scan
Technique known as half-opening of scanning for a pe connection uh not until TCP is formed. Rather a package of SYN is sent to the target port. If the SYN is received from the target port we can conclude that a port is in the status of listening.
3. TCP FIN scan
This technique of sending a FIN packet keport on target. Based on RFC 793, the target system will send back a RST for each port covered. This technique can only be used on the TCP/IP Stack-based UNIX

4. TCP X mas Tree Scan
This technique is only done by sending a package of FIN, URG, and Pussy to PORT targets

5. TCP null scan
TCP nul this scan can be done with memnuat off all flag.

6. The TCP ACK scan
Used to perform a firewall rule set mapping. This technique will help to determine whether it was a simple firewall packet filters that allow only a specific connection-connection or a firewall that is running it.

7. Windows TCP Scan
This technique can detect ports that are open or filtered or not filtered on a particular system.

8. TCP RPC scan
This technique is very specific that depends only on UNIX systems and is used to identify and conduct detection with port-pc and program as well as a version number that is connected with it
9. UDP scan
When a port that is sent ICMP message response PORT uncreable it his mark this port closed, but if it does not receive a message that is written above the packed can be interpreted as that Port open. The process is known as UDP technique so slow compared to other techniques.
