IDS

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is software that runs on a server or network device to monitor and track network activity. Using IDS, network administrators can configure the system to monitor network activity for suspicious behavior that may indicate unauthorized access attempts

IPS

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) like IDS follow the same process to collect and identify data and behavior, with the additional ability to block (prevent) activity. Network-Based IPS (NIPS) can hold all network traffic and inspect suspicious behaviour and code. Because it uses the in-line model, high performance is a crucial element of IPS devices in order to prevent the occurrence of bottlenecks on the network. Therefore, the NIPS are usually designed using three components to accelerate performance of bandwidth among other Network (Network processor) Chips, FPGA Chips, ASIC Chips



DISCUSSION



There are two types of IDS, which are:

Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS): all traffic that flows into a network will be analyzed to find whether there is a trial attack or infiltration into the system network. NIDS are generally located in important network segments on which the server resides or is present on the "entrance" of the network. The weakness of the NIDS is that NIDS somewhat complicated to implement in a network that uses the Ethernet switch, Ethernet switch vendors even though some now have implemented the function of IDS in his switch to monitor port or connection.
Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS): a host of individual network Activity will be monitored if a trial attack or intrusion into it or not. HIDS often placed on critical servers on the network, such as a firewall, web server, or a server that is connected to the Internet.

Types of IPS:

a. Host-based Intrusion Prevention System
Host-Based IPS (HIPS) works by forcing a group of fundamental software for the berkovensi constant. It is called by the Application Binary Interface (ABI). It is almost impossible to hijack an application without modifying the Application Binary Interface, because this Convention is universal among the applications are modified.

HIPS is a pecegahan system that consists of many layers, using packet filtering, inspection status and intrusion prevention methods that are real time to keep your host is under the circumstances of a decent performance efficiency. The mechanism works by preventing malicious code entering the host in order not executed without the need to check for threat signature.

b. Network Intrusion Prevention System
Network-Based IPS (NIPS), also referred to as "In-line proactive protection", holding all network traffic and inspect suspicious behaviour and code.
Because it uses the in-line model, high performance is a crucial element of IPS devices in order to prevent the occurrence of bottlenecks on the network. Therefore, the NIPS are usually designed using three components to accelerate performance of bandwidth, i.e.:

1. Network Chips (Network processor)
2. FPGA Chips
3. ASIC Chips
