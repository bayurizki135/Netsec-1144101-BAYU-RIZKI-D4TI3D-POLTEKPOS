Cryptography is a science to maintain the security of data during data transmission starting from the sender to eventually to kepenerima keamanaannya without waking someone change the authenticity of such data, this Cryptographic scrambles a data so people it's hard to read it. There are two stages of cryptography
1. Encode is changing the data into the form of a unique code hard to read and requires a key to open the data
2. Decode is a unique code to change the data are biased to read

Conclusion
Cryptography is scrambling data into unreadable so that unauthorized persons in unbiased open data
